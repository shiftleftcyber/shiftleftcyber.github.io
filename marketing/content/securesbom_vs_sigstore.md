A detailed comparison of **SecureSBOM** and **Sigstore**, two solutions advancing software supply chain security through SBOM signing and verification technologies.

While **Sigstore** focuses primarily on open-source projects and OCI artifacts, **SecureSBOM** is purpose-built for enterprise-grade SBOM signing, verification, and compliance.

---

## üß© Primary Use Case

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Purpose-built for enterprise and business software, focused on SBOM signing and verification. |
| **Sigstore** | Designed for open-source software with an OCI-centric approach (SBOMs attached as container artifacts). |

---

## üìò SBOM Support

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Native integration with the CycloneDX format (supports embedded signatures, property exclusion, canonicalization), and SPDX detached signatures. |
| **Sigstore** | Treats SBOMs as binary blobs; supports only detached signatures for both SPDX and CycloneDX. |

## üîê Key Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Automated key lifecycle management with HSM-backed protection; ideal for enterprise compliance and long-term trust. |
| **Sigstore** | Uses ephemeral, short-lived keys and certificates issued by Fulcio with OIDC authentication, or manual key management (local or via GCP/AWS). |

---

## ü™™ Authentication

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | API key‚Äìbased authentication supporting fine-grained access control and multi-tenant isolation. |
| **Sigstore** | OIDC-based authentication for keyless signing, or external self-managed authentication mechanisms. |

---

## üîç Transparency

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Maintains a private verification record. Verification is performed using the associated public key, keeping enterprise signing activity confidential. |
| **Sigstore** | Uses public transparency logs for verification, relying on public keys and records visible to all. |

---

## üß† Summary

- **SecureSBOM** is optimized for enterprise environments, providing deeper SBOM format integration, private key isolation, HSM-backed signing, and internal verification capabilities..
- **Sigstore** streamlines signing for open-source ecosystems and CI/CD workflows through OIDC identity proofing and public transparency.

---

### ‚úÖ Ideal Fit

| Recommended Solution | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Enterprise software, closed-source, or private projects. |
| **Sigstore** | Open-source projects and community-based CI/CD integrations. |
