A detailed comparison of **SecureSBOM** and **Sigstore**, two solutions addressing software supply chain integrity through signing and verification technologies.  
While **Sigstore** focuses primarily on open-source projects and OCI artifacts, **SecureSBOM** is built for enterprise-grade SBOM signing, verification, and compliance.

---

## üß© Primary Use Case

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Business / Enterprise Software, purpose-built for SBOM signing and verification. |
| **Sigstore** | Open Source Software, OCI-Focused (SBOMs attached as a container artifact). |

---

## üìò SBOM Support

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Integrates directly with the **CycloneDX SBOM format** ‚Äî supports **embedded signatures**, **property exclusion**, and also supports **SPDX detached signatures**. |
| **Sigstore** | Treats all SBOMs as simple blobs. Supports **detached signatures only** for both SPDX and CycloneDX. |

---

## üîê Key Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | **Automated** key lifecycle management using **HSMs**. Ideal for enterprise compliance and long-term trust. |
| **Sigstore** | Ephemeral, short-lived keys/certificates from **Fulcio** with **OIDC authentication** ‚Äî or manual key management (local or via cloud providers like GCP/AWS). |

---

## ü™™ Authentication

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | Authenticated via **API Key**, enabling fine-grained access control and multi-tenant isolation. |
| **Sigstore** | OIDC (for keyless signing) or external, self-managed authentication mechanisms. |

---

## üîç Transparency

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **SecureSBOM** | **Private Record** system ‚Äî verification performed using the **associated public key**, keeping enterprise signing activity confidential. |
| **Sigstore** | Public record via public transparency logs. Verification relies on public keys and the public transparency logs. |

---

## üß† Summary

- **SecureSBOM** focuses on enterprise adoption, providing stronger SBOM format integration, private key isolation, HSM-backed signing, and internal verification capabilities.
- **Sigstore** simplifies signing for open-source projects and CI/CD pipelines relying on OIDC identity proof and public transparency.
