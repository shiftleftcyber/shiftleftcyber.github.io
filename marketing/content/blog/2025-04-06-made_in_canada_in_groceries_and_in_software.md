With 🇺🇸 U.S.-imposed tariffs back in the news, many Canadians 🇨🇦 are shifting their focus to buy local and support Canadian-made products. But here's the catch: what does "Made in Canada" actually mean? 🤔

Flip over any grocery item and you’ll see all kinds of labels:

* 🇨🇦 Product of Canada
* 🛠️ Made in Canada
* 📦 Packaged in Canada
* 🌍 Made with domestic and imported ingredients
* 👨‍🍳 Prepared in Canada

The reality? Even with a "Made in Canada" label, ingredients often come from around the world 🌍.

Sound familiar? It should - and software is no different. 💻

Modern software is assembled, not handcrafted 🛠️ - just like hardware. When you manufacture a physical product, you need a Bill of Materials (BOM) to track every screw, chip, and wire 🔩⚙️🔌.

Software is no different. You need to track:

* 🏛️ Third-party libraries
* 🌎 Open-source packages
* 👩🏻‍💻 Proprietary code
* ⚙️ Software build tools

Even if your team "built it", much of it came from a global supply chain 🌎.

And just like with food, we need transparency in what we are consuming 🍲 - or shipping 🚢.

Knowing what's in your software helps you manage:

* 🔐 Security
* 💎 Quality
* 📈 Performance
* ⚠️ Risk

That's where a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) comes in - your blueprint for understanding what's inside your software. 📝

SBOMs are a great start to gain transparency. However, visibility alone isn’t enough. Can you trust what you see? 🕵

Have you checked the ingredients in your software lately? Do you know where they came from?
