Yes, even the one you just generated.

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is supposed to bring transparency and trust to your software supply chain. But what happens when that trust is exploited?

Here are just a few ways bad actors can manipulate or weaponize SBOMs:

🔍 Omission of Components

An SBOM that leaves out a vulnerable dependency is worse than useless - it gives a false sense of security.

≠ Mismatched Versions

Listing libxyz v2.1.0 when you're really running v1.4.0? Easy to do - and dangerous. You might think you've patched a CVE when you actually haven't.

🎭 SBOM Spoofing

Bad actors can generate fake SBOMs and pass them off as legitimate. No validation? No problem (for them).

🔧 Tampering

Even if your SBOM was accurate when generated, nothing stops someone from modifying it later - unless it's signed.

If you can't verify that an SBOM is authentic, complete, and current, you're leaving the door open for manipulation.

🧠 SBOMs without integrity are like unsealed envelopes - anyone can open it up and alter what's inside.

How do you verify the integrity of your SBOMs today? Is it automated? Do you sign and verify? I'd love to hear from others navigating this. 💬👇
