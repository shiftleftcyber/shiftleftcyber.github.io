## Understanding EO 14028: Enhancing the Nation’s Cybersecurity

In May 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14028, a transformative policy aimed at fortifying the United States' cybersecurity infrastructure. This order was a direct response to growing cyber threats, including high-profile incidents like the SolarWinds attack and ransomware assaults on critical infrastructure. EO 14028 focuses on modernizing federal cybersecurity practices and establishing robust frameworks to protect government systems and private-sector organizations involved in national security.

**Key Highlights of EO 14028**

- **Zero Trust Architecture:**
EO 14028 mandates federal agencies adopt a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)—a security model that assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default. Agencies are required to minimize implicit trust by enforcing strict authentication and authorization policies for all access to systems and data.
- **Improved Software Supply Chain Security:**
The order addresses vulnerabilities in the software supply chain by:

Requiring software providers to adhere to stringent development practices (e.g., multi-factor authentication, secure builds).
Mandating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all software used by federal agencies, providing transparency into components and dependencies.
Establishing a labeling system for software security standards, akin to nutrition labels.

- **Incident Detection and Response:**
To enhance threat detection, EO 14028 requires federal systems to deploy advanced technologies, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR). Agencies must also standardize logging practices to ensure timely forensic analysis during incidents.

- **Information Sharing:**
The order removes barriers to sharing threat intelligence between government and private-sector organizations. Enhanced communication is critical to responding to and mitigating sophisticated cyberattacks.

- **Federal Cloud Security:**
EO 14028 prioritizes the transition to secure cloud environments, emphasizing secure configurations, data encryption, and centralized security services.

**Why EO 14028 Matters**
EO 14028 is not just a federal directive; it’s a blueprint for modern cybersecurity practices applicable across industries. By focusing on proactive measures like ZTA and SBOMs, the order aims to reduce the attack surface and improve resilience against evolving cyber threats.

**What’s Next?**
Organizations engaging with the federal government must align their practices with EO 14028’s requirements. Even businesses outside the federal space can benefit from implementing its best practices, such as adopting ZTA or integrating SBOMs into their development pipelines.

As cyber threats grow in complexity, EO 14028 serves as a reminder that robust security is no longer optional—it’s essential.
