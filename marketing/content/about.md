## Why It Matters

*You cannot secure what you don’t know.*

In a rapidly scaling software ecosystem—where third-party and open-source components are ubiquitous—visibility into your software's composition is essential. SBOMs provide that **transparency**, enabling faster vulnerability response, stronger compliance, and supply chain trust. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

SecureSBOM consolidates all aspects of SBOM lifecycle management—from generation to sharing—into one unified, enterprise-ready framework.
